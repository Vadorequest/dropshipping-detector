## Features:
- Userscript (install it using Tampermonkey, on any browser)

## Userscript

This userscript detects whether the current site is a dropshipping website using Antidrop.fr's API. It provides a warning based on the probability of dropshipping activities on the site you're visiting.

- Identify whether the current website is e-commerce
- If e-commerce detected, calls Antidrop.fr API
- If "Dropshipping probability" is higher than allowed threshold, shows a full screen warning, otherwise, shows a top banner warning (don't show anything if probability is 0)
